**triplediff** is an R package for computing average treatment effects in Triple Differences Designs (also known as Difference-in-Differences-in-Differences or DDD). DDD designs are widely used in empirical work to relax parallel
trends assumptions in Difference-in-Differences settings. This package provides functions to estimate group-time average treatment effect and event-study type estimands associated with DDD designs. The setups allowed are:

- Two-periods or Multiple Periods DDD.
- Single Treatment Date and Variation in Treatment Timing (i.e., staggered adoption).
- Conditional and Unconditional DDD parallel trends assumptions.

The `triplediff` package implements the framework proposed in:

* [Ortiz-Villavicencio, Marcelo and Pedro H.C. Sant'Anna. \"Better Understanding Triple Differences Estimators\", 2025.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09942)


## Installation

You can install the latest *development* version of  `triplediff` from Github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("marcelortizv/triplediff")

library(triplediff)
```

## Quick Start: How to use `triplediff`

We provide a quick start example to illustrate the main features of the package. The UX is designed to be similar to the `did` package, so users familiar with it should feel comfortable using `triplediff`.

`ddd` is the main function for computing the DDD estimators proposed in [Ortiz-Villavicencio and Sant'Anna (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09942). At its core, `ddd` employs regression adjustment, inverse probability weighing, and doubly robust estimators that are valid under conditional DDD parallel trends.

To use `ddd`, the minimal data requirements include:

- `id`: Unit unique identifier (e.g., firm, individual, etc.). Its column name is associated with parameter `idname`.

- `period`: Time identifier (e.g., year, month, etc.). Its column name is associated with parameter `tname`.

- `outcome`: Outcome variable of interest. Its column name is associated with parameter `yname`.

- `state`: First period when treatment is enabled for a particular unit. It is a positive number for treated units and defines which group the unit belongs to. It takes value `0` or `Inf` for never-enabling units. Its column name is associated with parameter `gname`.

- `partition`: This is an indicator variable that is 1 for the units eligible for treatment and 0 otherwise. Its column name is associated with parameter `pname`.

The following are two simplified examples of how to use the `ddd` function. The first one is for a two-period DDD setup, while the second one is for a multiple-period DDD setup with staggered treatment adoption.

#### Case: Two-Periods DDD with covariates

First, we simulate some data with a built-in function `gen_dgp_2periods` that generates a two-period DDD setup with a single treatment date. This function receives the number of units and the type of DGP design to generate. The `gen_dgp_2periods` function returns a data frame with the required columns for the `ddd` function with 4 covariates.

```{r}
set.seed(1234) # Set seed for reproducibility
# Simulate data for a two-periods DDD setup
df <- gen_dgp_2periods(
  size = 5000, # Number of units
  dgp_type = 1 # Type of DGP design
)$data

head(df)

```
Now we can estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) using the `ddd` function. 

```{r}
# Estimate the average treatment effect on the treated, ATT(2,2)

att_22 <- ddd(yname = "y", tname = "time", idname = "id", gname = "state",
             pname = "partition", xformla = ~cov1 + cov2 + cov3 + cov4,
             data = df, control_group = "nevertreated", est_method = "dr")

summary(att_22)

```


#### Case: Multiple Periods DDD with staggered treatment adoption

Next, we can simulate some data with a built-in function `gen_dgp_mult_periods` that generates a multiple-period DDD setup with staggered treatment adoption. This function receives the number of units and the type of DGP design to generate. The `gen_dgp_mult_periods` function returns a data frame with the required columns for the `ddd` function with 4 covariates.

```{r}
set.seed(1234) # Set seed for reproducibility
# Simulate data for a multiple-period DDD setup with staggered treatment adoption
data <- gen_dgp_mult_periods(size = 500, dgp_type = 1)$data

head(data)
```

Now we can estimate the group-time average treatment effect on the treated using the `ddd` function. 

```{r}
# Estimate the group-time average treatment effect in DDD

att_gt <- ddd(yname = "y", tname = "time", idname = "id", gname = "state", 
              pname = "partition", xformla = ~cov1 + cov2 + cov3 + cov4,
              data = data, control_group = "nevertreated", 
              base_period = "universal", est_method = "dr")

summary(att_gt)
```

Then, we can aggregate the group-time average treatment effect on the treated to obtain the event-study type estimates. The `agg_ddd` function allows us to aggregate the results from the `ddd` function.
```{r}
es_e <- agg_ddd(att_gt, type = "eventstudy")

summary(es_e)
```

From these event-study type estimates, we can plot the results using the `ggplot` library to create crisp visualizations.
```{r, echo=FALSE, results="hide", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
es_df <- with(es_e$aggte_ddd, {
    tibble::tibble(period   = egt,
                   estimate = att.egt,
                   ci_lower = estimate - crit.val.egt * se.egt,
                   ci_upper = estimate + crit.val.egt * se.egt)
  })


all_per <- sort(unique(es_df$period))

p <- ggplot(es_df, aes(period, estimate)) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ci_lower, ymax = ci_upper),
                  width = .15,
                  position = position_dodge(width = .3)) +
    geom_point(size = 2.2,
               position = position_dodge(width = .3)) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linewidth = .3) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = -1, linetype = "dashed",
               linewidth = .3) +
    scale_x_continuous(
      breaks = all_per
    ) +
         labs(title = "",
         x = "Event Time",
         y = "Treatment Effect") +
    theme_bw(base_size = 12) +
    theme(plot.title   = element_text(hjust = .25),
          legend.position = "right")
  
  p

```

Finally, we can also estimate the group-time average treatment effect using a GMM-based estimator with not-yet-treated units as comparison group. This is done by setting the `control_group` parameter to `"notyettreated"` in the `ddd` function. 

```{r}
# do the same but using GMM-based notyettreated
att_gt_nyt <- ddd(yname = "y", tname = "time", idname = "id", gname = "state", 
              pname = "partition", xformla = ~cov1 + cov2 + cov3 + cov4,
              data = data, control_group = "notyettreated", 
              base_period = "universal", est_method = "dr")

summary(att_gt_nyt)
```

From this result, we can observe the standard errors for $ATT(2,2)$ are lower than the ones obtained with the `control_group = "nevertreated"` 
option since we leverage the additional information from the not-yet-treated units in the estimation.

 -  ⚠️ We recommend users to read our paper for further details on the GMM-based procedure and its difference with other estimators relying in not-yet-treated units as comparison group.

Description: Implements the Triple Differences (DDD) estimators for  assesing the average treatment effect on the treated
              proposed by Ortiz-Villavicencio and Sant'Anna (2024). It offers tools for
              estimating the DDD accomodating covariates and/or under multiple time periods. 
              At its core, the DDD estimator employs a combination of inverse probability weighting
              and outcome regression (i.e., nusiance functions) ensuring a doubly-robust property. 
              Furthemore, this package supports the implementation of machine learning methods for estimation of nuisance functions.
